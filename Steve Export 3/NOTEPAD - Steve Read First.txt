Hi Steve!

All of these parts should be made out of 12 gauge steel (the closest to 1/8" as possible).
None of these parts will require bends of any kind.

Strength Plate (0.125 steel) - 1 quantity
Strength Plate 2 (0.125 steel) - 1 quantity

Like always, thank you for all the work that you have graciously done for our team. It is well appreciated.

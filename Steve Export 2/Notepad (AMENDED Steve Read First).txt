Hi steve!

Hopefully the last big export of the year. There might be a few solitary parts after this in case something goes wrong, but this is the rest of the robot as designed.

All parts 0.125 aluminum

Parts with bends have PDFs and are marked with (bend) in the part name
ignore any other parentheses- these are for our internal part naming systems.
.IDW files are also for our own internal uses- you can ignore these.

Just as a heads up, Some of the parts have very similar names and look very similar, but are in fact different.
All bends should be indicated with our normal cuts on the side of the bendline.

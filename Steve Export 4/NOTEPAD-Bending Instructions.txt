For bending materials, the line for the brake should always line up on the side facing away from the most holes on the part. On the back flange pieces, where a group of
4 holes are close together and 2 on the other side of the piece, the brake line should fall on the edge of the cut out rectangle facing the two holes, or away from the four
holes. For the two pieces with a square formed by 4 holes and one offset on a narrow peninsula of metal, the edge that should be used for the brake should be the one facing 
the one offset hole, or the edge facing away from the 4. Let me know if this is confusing. Thanks.

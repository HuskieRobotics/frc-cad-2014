Hi Steve!

All parts that are immediately below should be cut out of .125" aluminum. The ones offset from the bunch just below are meant to be cut out of .125" polycarbonate.

Parts with bends have PDFs and are marked with (bend) in the part name
ignore any other parentheses- these are for our internal part naming systems.
.IDW files are also for our own internal uses- you can ignore these.

Just as a heads up, Some of the parts have very similar names and look very similar, but are in fact different.
All bends should be indicated with our normal cuts on the side of the bendline.
